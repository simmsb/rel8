### Added

- Added new `Conflict` and `Index` types. `Conflict` represents a [`conflict_target`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-insert.html#SQL-ON-CONFLICT) in an `ON CONFLICT`. It can be either a named constraint (`ON CONSTRAINT`) or a an `Index`.
- Added `Index`. `Index` is a description of a unique index which PostgreSQL can use for *unique index inference*. This is an alternative to specifying an explicit named constraint in a `conflict_target`.

### Changed

- The `Upsert` type was changed. Previously it had the columns (`index`, `predicate`) of what is now the `Index` type baked into its record. It now instead has a single `conflict` column (of type `Conflict`, which can be either an `Index` or a named constraint).
- The `DoNothing` constructor of `OnConflict` was changed to also take an optional `Conflict` value. Even though `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` does not generally require a `conflict_target`, there are cases where it can be necessary, e.g., if you have table that has both deferrable and non-deferrable constraints.
